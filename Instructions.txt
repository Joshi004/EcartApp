HI
following are the steps to run the project

1 . Download/Clone the file 

2 . There is a file for mongo DB commands to enter basic product details in database  copy the content of the file and paste in mongo DB console

Make sure you add all the content in database named as "mycart"

Now database is ready to be used

3. In project folder there is a sub-folder named server that is express code for server side

We have to open that using command prompt console using command
# Node app.js

Above command will throw  error because node modules are not present in that folder
Therefore first install node modules in the server project folder using following commands

# npm install

Now after making sure that mongo DB and node servers are working properly we need to open the project in angular

Follow the steps to run angular project of angular (client end )




4 In the project folder open the sub-folder named client  using visual studio code and run following commands

AFTER GETTING IN THE  CLIENT DIRECTORY

# npm  install (to install npm modules )
# ng serve --open (To start the Project )

It it doesn't open automatically go to Google Chrome and type following address
